This is by far my best attempt at any sort of application. I tried my best with error and input handling. Just thinking of the edge cases was hard. 
When initially creating the program. i had read the tasks wrong and filtered improperly. It was hard to make it work on the fly and change everything.
Doing this definitely sharpened my understanding of code-flow and logic.

One interesting piece of code from this project:

I was yearning for "clean" syntax to my standards. Trying to finish and see the end result of squeaky clean code.
I did this by doing 3 classes instead of two and calling methods into main from the other class. Granted, the other class looks very messy still and i definitely could've reduced redundancy further.
